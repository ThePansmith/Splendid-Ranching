jeo packjam repo!!!

## Contributing to a repository that uses the Panpack template
1. Clone your fork of the repository into an empty [`(instancename)\minecraft`](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9de6554-925d-4827-b51c-c7159e6f915f) folder
2. Copy the contents of `(instancename)\minecraft\.pakku\prism-overrides` into your `(instancename)` folder to have a working Prism Instance.

From there, you can start your newly created instance and the mods will be downloaded for you.
