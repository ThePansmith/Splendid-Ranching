3. Rename the cloned git repo folder to `minecraft` so it follows `instances/(instancename)/minecraft/`
4. Open `(instancename)\minecraft\` in terminal and run `pakku fetch` to download existing mods in repo from pakku manifest, if pakku is not locally installed use `java -jar pakku.jar fetch`
5. Copy the contents inside of `(instancename)\minecraft\.pakku\"prism-overrides"` and `"overrides"`into your `(instancename)` folder
